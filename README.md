- The entire code in jupyter notebook can be found [here!](https://github.com/gents98/Mini_Project_1015/blob/main/MiniProject-Finale.ipynb) 

## Data Source
ParseHub WebScraping from: 
- https://carplate.com.sg/
- https://carplate.sg/
- https://www.sgcarmart.com/directory/carplate_index.php


## Problem Definition
As Car Plates prices are determined by many factors such as supply & demand, uniqueness, biddings and etc, there is no solid factor that allows us to predict foreign number plates but in this mini-project, we decided to take on the challenge by reviewing how the past number plates are matched with its prices. 

## Motive
- The purpose of analysing carplate prices allows buyers and sellers to have a better understanding of where their carplate    stands in the market price as to avoid being short-changed in the case of buying/selling.
- We ought to be able to provide a good estimation of a price with any given Singapore Car Plate.

## Models Attempted
- Multi-Variate Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression (Non-Linear Regression)


## Libraries Used
- Pandas/ Numpy/ Seaborn/ MatplotLib.pyplot/ Sklearn
- Pandas - Groupby (Data Grouping)
- PbPython - Natural Break (Fisher-Jenks Algorithm)


## Additional Tools required to install
- Natural Breaking ("conda install -c conda-forge jenkspy") on ANACONDA.NAVIGATOR -> CMD.exe Prompt

## New Things We Learnt
- Natural Breaking Algorithm
- Pandas Groupby Function (Our Solution)
- Polynomial Regression (Non-linear Regression)
- Web Data Scraping (ParseHub Software)
- Self-Made Features/Variables
